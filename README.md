__bongy__

A python experimental utility to type Bengali.

Very experimental and deviates from the usual phonetic approach of converting typed English letters to Bengali. Does not fully work yet as well. WiP.

The application can be run in Gui mode and Server mode.
Currently the server supports REST requesta
GET /api/v1/<text> => Returns text converted to Bengali.
GET /mappings => Returns an HTML response with mapping info.
